<h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>
<p>This paper presents a novel multiperspective visualization (MPV) approach designed to improve navigation efficiency in Virtual Reality applications. The MPV is continuous and non-redundant, it shows the near part of the scene with a conventional, first-person visualization to anchor the user, and it is controlled with user head translations and rotations reminiscent of natural motion. Three types of anchored MPV are introduced, one that provides a lateral disocclusion effect, allowing the user to see around occluders and through side portals, one that provides a vertical disocclusion effect, allowing the user to see over and on top of occluders, and one that provides teleportation, allowing the user to relocate. The VR navigation efficiency benefits of the anchored MPV have been analyzed in a user study. Significant improvements were achieved in the metrics of number of teleportations and total distance traveled. In these metrics, large or greater Cohenâ€™s d effect sizes were observed at p-values below 0.05 in a first VR scene, while medium effect sizes at p-values of 0.1 or better were observed in a second VR scene.</p>
